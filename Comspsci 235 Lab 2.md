## Setting up GitHub

I downloaded Git on my pc. I configured my git username and email using the following commands on Git Bash:
```
git config --global user.name roaroftheearth
git config --global user.email mraj050@aucklanduni.ac.nz
```
Then I had to authenticate github to be used with my PC. The first step to doing this was generating a new SSH key using the following commands on Git Bash:
```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C mraj050@aucklanduni.ac.nz
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
Then I had to add the generated SSH key to my github account using the following command on Git Bash:
```
$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
This copies my key to the clipboard. Then I navigated to my Github settings page and added the key to my account.

## Branching and Forking

I created a repository on github called "compsci235-lab2" without a .gitignore file and a readme file generated.

I then had to clone this repo on to my PC using the following commands on Conda/VSCode using the link generated by github:
```
git clone git@github.com:roaroftheearth/compsci235-lab2.git
```
I then downloaded the startup project from Canvas and moved it to the cloned repo folder on my PC.

I then used Conda/VSC to create an environment and generate a requirements.txt file like I did for the previous Lab.

I then used the following commands on Conda/VSC to add the new files to my repo on github:
```
git add -A
git commit -m "update 1"
git push origin main
```

## Branching and merging

I created a new branch and navigated to it using the following commands on VSC:
```
git branch getrand
git checkout getrand
```
I then modified the code and implemented a get_rand() definition and toss_coin() definition.
```
def get_rand():
    '''Returns a random integer.'''
    my_randint = random.randint(1,99)
    return my_randint


def toss_coin():
    '''Return either Head or Tail'''
    coin_choice = random.randint(1,2)
    if coin_choice == 1:
        coin = 'Head'
        return coin
    elif coin_choice == 2:
        coin = 'Tail'
        return coin
